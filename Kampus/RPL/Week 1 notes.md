# What is software
## What is a software
- **Instructions** : When executed will return desired outcomes
- **Data Structures** : Capable of manipulating information and data
- **Documentation** : Describes the operation and use of program
## Characteristics of Software
1. Software is developed or engineered
2. Most software is custom-built, although there are many industry that is moving towards component-based construction
3. Software doesn't "wear out" - it’s deteriorate
	1. Hardware failure rate depicted in a form of the “bathtub curve”

4. Software application example
	- System software
		- os windows, etc
	- Application software 
	- Engineering/scientific software 
		- Matlab, octave, etc
	- Embedded software 
	- Product-line software 
	- WebApps (Web applications) 
		- Web development
	- AI software
		- chat gpt
## Information System
- Information System is a software, since it checked all the requirements for one. 
- But not all software are information system. 
- An IS for different organization has different features.
