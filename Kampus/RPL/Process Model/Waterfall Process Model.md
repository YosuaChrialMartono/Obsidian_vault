- Each activities are done sequentially
### Use when:
- Requirements are fixed and well defined since beginning of the project
- Development work flows linearly

### Pros & Cons
#### Pros:
- Similar to process models used in other engineering fields.
- The system requirements are identified long before programming begins.
- High project visibility i.e. easy to track.
- Changes to the requirements are minimized as the project proceeds.
#### Cons:
- Real project rarely follow sequential flow.
- Hard to accommodate changes in the middle of project.
- Working product will not be available until late in the project timeline.
- The design must be completely specified before programming begins.
- A long time elapses between the completion of the analysis phase and the delivery of the system.

#### TLDR:
- Pros: All requirements are known, easy tracking, minimum changes
- Cons: Very strict, rare cases, hard to do changes, working product will be available in a very long time (since we need to wait till the end of project)

### Variants
#### V Shaped Model
