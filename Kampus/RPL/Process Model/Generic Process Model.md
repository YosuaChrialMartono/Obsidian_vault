```

A process usually involves a set of tools and techniques
Characteristics of a process: 
- prescribes all major process activities 
- uses resources, subject to a set of constraints, and produces intermediate and final products 
- may be composed of subprocesses linked together 
- each process activity has entry and exit criteria 
- each activity are organized in a sequence 
- every process has a set of guiding principles 
- constraints or controls may apply to an activity

- Process is also called **life cycle** when it involves the building of some product
- Software development process is also called software life cycle

# Software development process

## 5 Generic Framework Activities
1. Communication
	1. Communicate and collaborate with customers and other stakeholders
	2. Gather requirements that define software features and functions
2. Planning
	1. Making a "map" that help the team navigate the journey
3. Modelling
	1. Designing the software that fulfills the requirement set
4. Construction
	1. **Code generation**
	2. **Testing**
5. Deployment
	1. Deliver the product to the client
