- **Users get a feel for the “actual system”** and developers get to build something immediately
	- because they can immediately try the created prototype
- Assists you and other stakeholders to better understand what is to be built when requirements are fuzzy

# Pros & Cons
## Pros
- Can clarify user requirements better
- Better visibility of project’s progress

## Cons
- Less comprehensive analysis
- Rapid changes may hard to document

# Prototyping Flow
- Establish Prototype Objectives 
	- Make sure both team and customer have the same visions regarding the prototype 
- Define Prototype Functionality 
	- Determine features and functions that will be included in the prototype 
- Develop Prototype 
	- Design considerations may be relaxed to reduce cost and time
- Evaluate Prototype

# Throwaway prototype?
Throwaway prototype vs. prototype as actual system 
- Compromises often made to get prototype done quickly 
- Stakeholders often see the prototype as the “working product” 
- In one idealistic view, first prototype should be “thrown away” 
- Evolutionary view suggests prototype may evolve into actual system
