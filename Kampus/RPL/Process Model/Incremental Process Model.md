# Description
We are producing software in "increments", 
- E.g. developing a word processor : 1st increment provides basic text editing and file management, 2nd increment provides text styling, and so forth
# Things to note
- Every increment can be run parallel to each other
- Combines linear and parallel flows

# Use When
- Requirements are well understood
	- and can be partitioned into separated increments
- There is a need to deliver a set of functionality to users quickly
- Note : Incremental development may be hard to adopt in large organisations that have established bureaucratic procedures

# Pros & Cons
## Pros
- Cost of accommodating changes is reduced
- Easier to get customer feedback
- Rapid delivery and deployment of useful software

## Cons
- The process is not visible
- System structure tends to degrade as new increments are added

# Phased Developments
