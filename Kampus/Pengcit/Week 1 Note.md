# Computer Graphic
- Creating images and animating objects digitally. 
- Processes, techniques, and methods to create images based on abstract descriptions of objects and their surrounding environments 
	- Pure animation 
	- Motion capture 
	- etc.. 
- Processes, techniques, and methods to create realism effects of objects and their surrounding environments

# Realism

```
Ada korelasi dari seberapa jauh kita familiar dengan suatu gambar dengan miripnya gambar tersebut dengan manusia
```

# Fundamental Steps
![[Pasted image 20230831135745.png]]

# Image Acquisition

- Normal camera or eye 
- Gamma Ray 
	- Bone Scan
	- PET Scan	  ![[Pasted image 20230831140822.png]]
- X-Ray Imaging
	- X-Ray radiation intensity
	- Contrast Injections![[Pasted image 20230831140811.png]]
- Ultraviolet Imaging
	- Fluorescence Microscopy
	  Fluorescence is the emission of light by a substance that has absorbed light or other electromagnetic radiation ![[Pasted image 20230831140756.png]]
- Infrared Imaging
	- Near Infrared vs Thermal Infrared
		- Near-infrared is very close to the visible spectrum, so it captures human features that closely resemble those taken in the visible spectrum.
		- Thermal infrared captures only the temperature

- Microwave Imaging
	- Used for ```Radar``` application, it is not affected by weather and ambient lighting conditions
	- Spaceborne radar image of southern Tibet mountains (image by NASA) ![[Pasted image 20230831140737.png]]
- Radio Wave Imaging
	- Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)
		- The human body is place in a magnet
		- Radio pulses are passed through the body, and the human tissue gives a response![[Pasted image 20230831140926.png]]
- Multispectral Imaging
	- Hyper/multispectral imaging is an advanced imaging technique that acquires images where each pixel contains a spectrum (intensity as a function of wavelength) of the intensities, rather than the typical three data points (red, green and blue) found in RGB images.![[Pasted image 20230831140944.png]]![[Pasted image 20230831140949.png]]
