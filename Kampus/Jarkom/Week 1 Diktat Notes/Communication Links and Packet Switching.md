# Communication Links
communication links is a connection or transmission technologies that connects particular machine. The link enables the communication of states/stations

### Point-to-Point connection

This connection connects two point of machine and only 2. If we want to connect more than 1 then we need more connections.
Example : Cable connection between a phone and a computer
### Multipoint Connection

This connection connect multiple machine with a single line. As it is using a single line its capabilities is also affected by the number of connected machine. 
**Sharing Mechanism :**
- Spatial sharing happened if several state or devices can share the link simultaneously. 
- Temporal sharing occur if users must take turns while using the link.

# Packet Switching
Short definition from the website:
```
The routing and transferring of data by means of addressed packets so that a channel is occupied during the transmission of the packet only, and upon completion of the transmission the channel is made available for the transfer of other traffic.
```

- Packet Switching segments the data into several packages so that it decreases the load on transferring data.
- Each packets include segmented data, IP address, and sequencing information.
- Each packet can travel through different path on the network.
- The path of each packet is the fastest path on that time based on the traffic and transmission quality of the channels. 
- This mechanism enables the network to still be available even though there is a link that is down, more fault-tolerant.
- Therefore, this method is more cost-effective and efficient then circuit switching.

- The data sent isn't always in correct order thus the receiver need to sort and then merge the data again
- This method is more flexible since it does not reserve the path until the connection is terminated.
- However, there is some amount of delay in packet switching, whereas circuit switching is better for transmitting real-time data.
